# Verisimilitude

## Background

The Oxford Dictionary defines *verisimilitude* as *"The appearance of being true or real."* When we submit solutions to competitive programming contests, the judging system does not check if our solutions are provably correct. Rather, our solutions are accepted if they pass the pre-defined test cases and thus *appear to be correct*.

Verisimilitude (**Veris** for short) began as a simple command-line interfacing script written by **Alex Coleman** and **Timothy Buzzelli** (both former members of the UCF Programming Team and 2018 ACM-ICPC World Finals Bronze Medalists.) After constant iteration and development, Veris made its way from a command-line tool to a robust and powerful judging tool with a simple UI. Since then, Timothy Buzzelli has been constantly adding improvements to Veris based on feature requests from UCF Programming Teammembers.

## Mission Statement

Verisimilitude seeks to be a comprehensive tool for judging competitive programming solutions locally given a solution, data path, and checker.
